# Project Title: Maze Path Finder

This project showcases a breadth first search and depth first search on a maze. Ultimately, a path from the start point and end point is rendered visually.

 The graph is represented by an adjacency matrix but limited to (n x n) dimensions instead of (m x n). The chosen language of choice was JavaScript.

Additionally, the user has the ability to build the maze using walls, a start node, end node, and delete node properties. This means each maze can be unique.
